# day Journal using Django framework

I made this journal by using "Django, Python, SQLite3". basically I have used "super user" to keep journal privet.
all needed files and snapshots are given in Git. <br>
reason to build this project => <br>
    -These days, 80% students don't carry there diary but they always keep there laptop or phones with them, <br>
    -my this project is to help those to carry there "moment hai!" stuff with them :)  <br>
    -one can use this online journal to maintain your life records,  <br>
    -it's still in improvement phase.  <br>

Thanks for checking out!
