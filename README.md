# day Journal using Django framework

I made this journal by using "Django, Python, SQLite3". basically I have used "super user" to keep journal privet.
all needed files and snapshots are given in Git. <br>
reason to build:
    These days, 80% students don't carry there diary but they always keep there laptop or phones with them,
    my this project is to help those to carry there "moment hai!" stuff with them :) 
    one can use this online journal to maintain your life records,
    it's still in improvement phase. 

Thank you for checking out!
